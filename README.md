## Problem Statement :bulb:
 Large scale garbage bburning generates vast amounts of heat that is generally wasted in a largerarea of earth. .

## Proposed Solution :gear:
Our product is capable of converting heat energy generated through burning any substance, into electrical energy. .


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#table-of-contents)

## Concept :hammer_and_wrench:	

- Our device is made up of heating sensors that are placed near a heat source and can convert the heat produced into electricity.
- This electricity is either stored in a battery or capacitor, or it is directly applied to the bulb or other electrical appliances connected to the sensor. After burning roughly 5g of garbage for up to 30 seconds, our device currently delivers enough electricity to light a medium-sized torch for 3 minutes.
- The generated energy could be used immediately or stored in batteries for later use. The gadget can be used in businesses such as near chimneys, in homes such as stove tops or charging inverter batteries, and in any other steady heat emission source.
- Our system is not dependent on any other aspect, with the exception of the availability of continuous heat supply near the heating panels.
- This simple method of energy conversion caters to a sustainable and environmentally friendly use of the world's garbage.

## How it works?	:warning:
- When we burn waste items such as paper, we generate heat energy, which is absorbed by heating sensors and heating panels and converted into electrical energy.
- After that, the generated electrical energy is passed through a diode (IN4007), which allows us to hold the electrical energy and prevents it from flowing backward. 
- The electrical energy is then stored in a battery with a switch that allows us to use it as needed.
- In this prototype, we demonstrated the usage of stored electrical energy generated by waste burning with the use of LEDs.
- Our prototype presently delivers enough electricity to light a medium-sized torch for 3 minutes after burning roughly 5g of garbage for up to 30 seconds.

## Software Installation Process :woman_office_worker::technologist:

1.) Go to the software folder inside that you will find a software folder go to that folder.

2.) There are a total of three software vscode, Arduino IDE, and xampp.

3.) To download xampp just click on xampp installer.exe.

4.) To download Arduino IDE you can directly download the application from the Microsoft store or go to Arduino folder and click on arduino.exe.

5.) To download vscode just click on vscode installer.exe.

<h3>To Run our Dashboard</h3>

1.) To run the dashboard of our project you have to paste our dashboard folder in xampp. After successful installation of xampp you have to copy the dashboard folder then go to c:/ c drive ---> then open xampp folder ---> inside that you will find htdocs folder --> inside that you have put out dashboard folder.

2.) To upload our data into mysql database --> open xampp --> start mysql & apache --> go to browser --> type localhost you will find localhost dashboard.

3.) To go to the database click on PHPMyAdmin or type in browser localhost/PHPMyAdmin.

4.) In PHPMyAdmin upload our database file that is SQL file name u489595468_kissania.sql .

5.) After that To run our dashboard just open the browser and type localhost/thermon website/index.php.

6.) You will find our dashboard and there you can navigate to different tabs.

<h5>Note</h5> - In this config section please change config file setting set for that go to includes folder inside that open config file

define('DB_SERVER','localhost');
define('DB_USER','root');
define('DB_PASS' ,'');
define('DB_NAME', 'u489595468_kissania');

<i>Update this above code in the admin panel for that go to admin folder --> open includes folder inside that open config file.</i>


<h3>To run suction pump code</h3>

1.) You required some sensors and microcontrollers such as MQ2 smoke sensor,buzzer, suction pump, nodemcu esp8266, jumper wire, rgb leds.

2.) To upload the code into the hardware device connect your nodemcu into laptop/desktop and then open Arduino IDE and open file name heart.ino

3.) To run this you need to include the blynk library in the Arduino IDE. To include the library go to https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/releases/tag/v1.0.1 this link download Blynk_Release_v1.0.1.zip file and after download unzip that file. when you unzip that you will find two folders that are tools and libraries just copy those 2 folders and paste them to your Arduino IDE sketchbook in my case the path is C:\Users\HP\Documents\Arduino but it can depend at the time of installation if you change the path. To check the path open Arduino IDE and click on files and then go to preference at there you will find your sketchbook path.

4.)Upload that code into nodemcu and then just you have connected the sensor to the nodemcu.

5.)After that you check the working in the serial monitor.
